Project repository for MSFS Chinese 5th generation fighter J20 (Mighty Dragon). This project is primarily meant to be a study platform for MSFS aircraft development, exact replication of the J20 aircraft is non-essential at this moment. This repository serves as a resource for anyone desiring to have a hands-on in MSFS aircraft development.

Features included:
* working cockpit with animations
* animated flight control surfaces
* interior and exterior lightings
* engine animation with afterburners
* cockpit lighting with color accent.
To change cockpit accent, select and copy your color of choice from [Community folder]/h0rnb1ll-aircraft-j20/cockpit-accent, replace default COCKPIT_ACCENT.PNG.DDS file in [Community folder]\h0rnb1ll-aircraft-j20\SimObjects\airplanes\hbl-aircraft-j20\texture. Make sure the new file is also named COCKPIT_ACCENT.PNG.DDS. You may also create your own color scheme.

Known issues:    
Many performance information on the J-20 stealth fighter are still classified. This project takes heavy reference from its closest counterpart - Lockheed Martin F-22 Raptor. The flight model will be updated, once more info becomes available. Cockpit and exterior model will continue to be improved over time.
- cockpit seat fictional, not much public information on which type of seat is being used in the J-20
- avionics are using generic MSFS templates at this moment
- thrust vectors yet to be implemented (not avail. in Saturn / Shenyang WS-10 engines IRL, probable with WS-15 introduction)
